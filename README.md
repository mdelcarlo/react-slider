# React-Slider

The Slider control for React.

### Development Practices

All source code should be formatted with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).
Code is not automatically formatted in commit hooks to avoid unexpected behaviour,
so we recommended using an editor plugin to format your code as you work.
You can also run `yarn format` to prettier all the things.
The `lint` script will validate source code with both ESLint and prettier.
